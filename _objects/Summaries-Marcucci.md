## [Data and Metadata], [2024-09-25]
The “Data & Metadata for Historians” course led by Sofia Papastamkou taught us and especially me how historians can engage with historical sources in the digital age. It emphasized the importance of evolving research methods through digital technologies and data management. We learned to distinguish “digital history,” which incorporates digital sources and tools, from merely “digitized sources”, often analyzed with techniques like artificial intelligence. A key focus was on understanding “Data,” revealing that it consists of interpreted elements actively constructed by researchers. We also explored different types of “Metadata,” essential for organizing, interpreting, and sharing historical resources by how I interpretated it. For instance, we examined a timeline created by users on a website that illustrated how metadata provides temporal context by being statistically classified under “created, digitized, found by you”. A Flickr example showcased a tweet explaining the incorporated metadata, highlighting its role in enhancing our understanding of digital sources. These examples helped me to better understand the meaning of “Data” and of “Metadata”. Finally, we were introduced to “Tropy,” a software tool for managing and archiving digitized historical sources. I had not encountered this tool before, but it could prove invaluable for future projects.
Overall, this course has enhanced our understanding of how data and metadata enrich historical research methods, equipping us with practical tools for navigating digital history. While I found the information presented by Ms. Papastamkou on September 25 challenging, the course clarified the distinctions between data and metadata, which I previously overlooked. Also, Ms. Papastamkou demonstrated understanding of our difficulties, providing a supportive environment that made us feel acknowledged and unhurried.

## [Web Archives], [2024-10-02]
The course Web Archives” was a refreshing departure from traditional lecture-based learning. Unlike previous sessions, where the professor spoke and the students passively listened, this session was much more interactive and engaging. From the start, we were actively involved in the learning process, divides into groups, and given the freedom to choose assignments. This gave the experience a more personal and collaborative touch. My group chose Assignment 3, “Archiving Luxembourg.lu”, where we explored the evolution of Luxembourg’s official web portal. 
Using the Wayback Machine, we traced the site’s history by entering the URL www.luxembourg.lu. it was fascinating to see how the website had changed overtime. We examined the information and resources available in various archived version, comparing the earliest and most recent pages. Analyzing the shifts in content, design, and accessibility, we gained valuable insights into how Luxembourg’s digital presence has evolved – an intriguing discovery for all of us.
After conducting our research, we presented our findings in a five-minute presentation. Although we did not have as much time to prepare as we’d have liked, the feedback from our professors was very helpful. Their thoughtful questions, not only for our group but for every single group, encouraged us to think more deeply about the subject. Each group’s presentation was unique, offering a wide range of interesting topics and perspectives. I found the last group’s project particularly engaging, as they added insights that made their presentation more relatable.
Overall, this hands-on approach made the course far more enjoyable and memorable. Instead of just learning facts, we applied what we learned, making the experience both meaningful and fun.
