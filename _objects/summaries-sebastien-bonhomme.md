## Summary of the 25th of September 2024 session of Introduction to Digital History

During the Introduction to Digital History lesson of the 25th of September 2024, we were introduced to a few key elements of digital history, namely who is and who isn’t a digital historian and what is data and the related metadata. A digital historian for example isn’t just any historian who uses digital tools, but all historians today are confronted with sources that are digitalised.
Data, initially a Latin loanword, became a proper English word in the late 18th century and meant “the admitted elements of a problem”. In our context, data are things/information we create, store, manipulate, analyse and interpret. On that matter, data used as sources for a historian’s work becomes “research data”.
Metadata, on the other hand, is, in short terms, the data of the data, the information around the information. Thus, for example, a picture file is the data, but its name, its date of creation and upload for example are metadata. There are two types of metadata, on one side embedded data, which the machine creates automatically, on the other, enriched data, which is created by the used/the historian.
We were also introduced to Trophy, a program that enables one to save, organize adequately and describe with tags image files used by historians as research data. In other terms, it is kind of like Zotero in many ways, but for images, although some key features of Zotero like the generating of citations is notably absent.

## Summary of the 2nd of October 2024 session of Introduction to Digital History

During the Introduction to Digital History lesson of the 25th of September 2024, we were acquainted with the concept of web archives in their vast array of forms as digital vaults key to storing a variety of data in all their forms. The lesson took, for this occasion, a more student-participative approach as we were divided into 6 groups to each present a different example and their aspects.
A first group presented the Internet Archive, a non-profit organization formed in 1996 which aims to preserve documents, files, songs, movies and websites on the Internet. Internet Archive must regularly face lawsuits by companies and labels accusing them of copyright infringement as many books are also made available on the archive. A second group presented a sort of Luxembourgish version of the Internet Archive called Luxembourg Archive, a project by the BNL which aims to preserve among others Luxembourgish Websites of which they take 4 screenshots every year. A third group presented the “Wayback Machine”, affiliated with the Internet Archive, a website that let’s one visit how a specific site looked like eons ago, if a version of it had been saved. A fourth group analysed the “revision history” of a Wikipedia article, showing a variety of details and changes made over time, some useful, and some cases of vandalism.
The fifth group presented archives on a more personal level, the family, with images, but also by presenting how they themselves had shared data and information regarding family online as is subconsciously done frequently by many people.
The final group presented the September 11th Digital Archive, an archive with the goal of preserving data and a variety of media, partially made available by private persons, related to the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attack on the Twin Towers.
