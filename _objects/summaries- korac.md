## Data, Metadata and Tropy, 25-09-2024
The main topics of the last course given by Sofia Papastamkou were about data and
metadata, followed by a brief introduction of tropy. The lesson was divided into three
categories. The first category delt with the definitions of data and metadata. What is data?
The notion of data changed its meaning over time. After the 18th century the definition of
data extended beyond mathematics and theology, the use of which became more
generalized. In the 21st century, becoming more and more connected and digitalized,
witnessed the emergence of historical data. Historians can produce their own (historical)
data which can be manifold and versatile. So in short data are things that we create,
collect, store, analyze etc,… Research data are factual records ( images, sounds,
maps,…) used as primary sources for scientific research, accepted by the scientific
community and seen as necessary for the validation of research findings. Research data
can differ between two types of research data: qualitative and quantitative data. The
second topic of interest of the course was metadata, which is to put it simply ‘information
about information’. Metadata can be useful in order to organize, structure, identify,…
data. The explanation of metadata was illustrated by some examples of metadata, like the
analysis of image files and Instagram posts.
The last part of the course was a short introduction of Tropy, a specialized software which
enables you to organize and describe photographs of research material ( photos).

## Web Archives, 02-10-2024
The class from 02.10.2024 was given by Sofia Papastamkou and it was about web archives. The course was structured in two parts. In the first part the students made groups of three and could choose an assignment. In all there were seven different assignments, but all the assignments focused on a different type of web archive. Afterwards the students were given approximately fifty minutes to answer some questions. The questions were in relation with the web archive an focused on the function, the policies, the methods and limits of those. The latter part of the session was dedicated to a five-minute oral presentation from each group about their findings of their web archive. In my case it was assignment 2- Luxembourg Web Archive. The Luxembourg Web archive is a project of the BNL (Bibliothèque nationale du Luxembourg). One of BNL’s missions is to collect and preserve all publications issued in Luxembourg, as well as foreign publications in relation with Luxembourg. The BNL collects not only printed media, but it also covers digital publications of all kinds. Even Luxembourgish websites. All websites with an ‘’.lu’’ domain, published, hosted or in relation with Luxembourg are being snapshotted 4 times a year and archived. Nevertheless, BNL’s web archive project is relatively new and therefore also limited in some aspects. YouTube videos, podcasts or music videos are not yet archived. To draw the bottom line BNL’s web archive project is a useful and promising tool for everyone interested in research.

## Online Newspaper Archives& Tool 3 'impresso', 09-10-2024
Course number 4 was held by Marten During, and the course was named ‘Online Newspaper Archives – Tool 3 ‘impresso’’. The course was structured in two parts. The first part introduced us to the world of newspapers, their role in historical research, and the importance of archiving newspaper collections. Besides emphasizing the value of newspapers, we were also introduced to impresso. 
The second part of the class was the practical application of the theoretical concepts. Returning to the first half of the course, the importance of newspaper collections lies in the fact that newspapers themselves can be utilized in various ways. They can serve as primary sources for research because they offer a broad and diverse range of information about the past. For example, they reflect ideas, past knowledge, and the ways people used to think, speak, and dress. In other words, newspapers mirror past societies. Furthermore, one can observe the evolution of printed media and how writing styles have changed, including how advertisements were once crafted. Newspapers also provide visual support by depicting people, politicians, and so on. For these reasons, we were instructed in and shown how to use the impresso app, which is a newspaper archive that collects Luxembourgish and Swiss newspapers. impresso allows users to utilize archived newspapers in a variety of ways. For example, impresso can help us to segment newspapers and make them more accessible for historical research. Another feature of impresso is that it transcends national borders by storing not only Luxembourgish newspapers but also Swiss ones, and in multiple languages.
The second part of the class was dedicated to experimenting with impresso and using its various options, such as ngrams, search, text reuse, and inspect & compare. The goal was to learn how to critically analyze the results generated by impresso.
