## Data, Metadata and Tropy, 25-09-2024
This course explored how historical practices have evolved in the digital era. The beginning of the course differentiated between “digital history”, which involves leveraging new technologies, and “history in the digital age”, where historians work with digitized sources. A key focus of the course was on the crucial role of data management in the process of historical research. Initially rooted in mathematics through Euclid (4th c. A.D.), the concept of “data” broadened in the 18th century. Today, “data” refers to interpreted elements actively shaped by researchers. This digital revolution has led to an abundance of different types of data that were once scarce. 
The course emphasized that digital transformation affects every stage of historical research, from source discovery and analysis to interpretation, dissemination, and preservation. In this context, “data” becomes “research data”. Historians engage with diverse sources, ranging from texts to physical artifacts, which are structured through “metadata”. Central to the course, “metadata”, defined simply as “data about data”, is essential for organizing and interpreting historical materials. We examined various examples of metadata, from digital heritage collections to social media posts and online photo archives, highlighting its significance for historians. 
We also learned about the role of data repositories in storing and preserving different types of data, ensuring future accessibility for research. In the final section of the course, we were introduced to “Tropy”, a software tool designed for managing and archiving digitized historical sources. It allows historians to explore innovative ways of organizing and interpreting digital materials, offering valuable support in their research endeavors.

I personally find it challenging to shift from traditional historical methods to digital approaches. The course feels quite technical and theoretical to me. Reviewing the slides at home helped clarify some concepts, but not all, which left me feeling like I was attending a Computer Science class rather than a history course. Additionally, the pace of the lectures was too fast, and I struggled to fully grasp the professor’s explanations.

## Web Archives, 02-10-2024
This course introduced to us web archives. The course emphasized interaction, as it was divided into the following two parts: The first part involved forming groups of three or four people, and these groups had to choose one of the seven topics proposed by the professors. The second part was about presenting and discussing the subjects with the class. The first topic focused on the importance of digital archives and the preservation of websites, highlighting the Internet Archive. The second topic, titles “Luxembourg Web Archive”, which was the subject chosen by Kenan Korac and me, focused on the National Library of Luxembourg, where we explored the missions, policies, organization, limitations, and collaborations regarding the digital heritage preservation of the BNL. The next topic, titles “Archiving.lu”, involved students exploring the evolution of the “Luxembourg.lu” website using the “Wayback Machine”, a digital archive of websites from the Internet Archive. The fourth topic, titles “Collecting Social Media (YouTube) Data”, emphasized how to use YouTube comments as data for research, and students also explored their individual digital footprints. The fifth topic was dedicated to the fluidity of the web and focused on various digital technologies. The next topic revisited individual footprints on the web and how they are archived, such as linking an individual to a sport’s club’s website. Finally, the last topic centered on the digital archive of September 11, 2001, where we discussed the historical value of photos on this specific site and the associated risks.

I personally found the course very interactive, and much better than the first one, because it was much less theoretical. The fact that we could read and discuss different kinds of web archives in groups and then have a class discussion made it easier to understand the importance of web archives.
