## Data, Metadata and Tropy, 25/09/2024
In a first step, the course dealt with the terms of data and metadata and presented their differences and their use. I think the video shown in the course made it possible to quickly and easily visualise the differences and thus understand the basic information for the later course. 
Data therefore refers to ‘facts’ or ‘pieces of information’. The organisation of different data can therefore be referred to as a dataset. Metadata, on the other hand, is simply data that describes other data. It provides information about the information. An example of this is if you have 100 different newspaper articles and organise them according to, for example, the language in which the article was written, the period of publication or the name of the newspaper.
Another example of data is research data. These are factual records that are used for the validation of research findings. Examples of such factual records vary depending on the research. They can be numerical values, text records or images and sounds.
In a second step, the Tropy software was presented. I can't say much about the Tropy software for this course, only that it is a software that allows you to organise different photos of research materials. In the course, Tropy was only covered for the last 10 minutes in fast forward, which meant that I personally did not yet fully understand how to use Tropy. 

In future courses where new tools are introduced, more time should be spent on explaining the tool to the students instead of having a purely theoretical course and not having enough time at the end to explain the software in more detail.

## Web Archives, 02/10/2024
The course, held on 2 October addressed the subject of web archives. To work through the different themes of this topic, we were divided into six groups, each tasked with a specific exercise related to web archives. These groups then presented their findings to the class.
While the other groups dealt with topics such as the stakes of archiving the web, the Luxembourg Web Archive, Archiving luxembourg.lu, fluidity of the web or crowdsourced born digital archives, my group dealt with the topic of family and personal archives in the web.
In my group's assignment, we looked at a web archive created by a private individual, Roy Simons, which was about his grandfather. He created this web archive using the free website service Webklik. However, such privately created websites have the problem that they can disappear over time, for example due to copyright problems. After some time, his web archives were taken over by a web hosting service company Weebly, which also took the content with it. The content that Roy Simons had put on the web was all deleted and the new site that was created is no longer a personal family archive but a collection on a central theme where no people or relatives are named. 
In a second step, we searched for ourselves on the internet and checked whether we were archived on the web. We didn't find much about ourselves, but we did notice some photos of us on the web that we didn't know about, mainly from magazines.

I personally liked the way this course was organised. Instead of a purely theoretical course, you were able to discuss a topic in small groups and the experimentation with the Wayback Machine was also entertaining. In addition, the lecturer's intervention with additional information after each presentation was clear and easier to absorb than during a purely theoretical lesson.
