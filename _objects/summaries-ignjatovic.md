## Data, Metadata and Tropy, 25.09.2024
In the ‘Introduction to Digital History’ course on 26 September, we dealt with the topic of ‘data’ and were told exactly what ‘data’ is and what different types of ‘data’ there are. In the course, we were told that ‘data’ are (digital) things that we can create or collect, for example. The course also showed us what other types of data there are, such as ‘research data’ or ‘metadata’. The course also taught us what metadata is, if you must explain it very simply, it is data that describes other data. We also learnt about metadata from a video. This is information that describes sources such as documents or images. We also learnt why metadata is important because it helps you to organize information or knowledge. After the explanation about metadata, we saw examples of metadata to understand it better. As the last point of the course, we saw data repositories that are used to store, preserve, publish and share data, such as Zenodo, figshare or Havard Dataverse. Data repositories make it easier to access and retrieve data. We were also explained what Tropy is. This is software that is used to organize or describe photos of research material. One possible criticism of the course is that I personally missed a short introduction or explanation of the Tropy software in the course. I felt that the rest of the lessons had a good structure. I just found there was a lot of information at once and I also found it difficult to keep up with everything in the course. But I also understand that the topic of the course is a complex one.
