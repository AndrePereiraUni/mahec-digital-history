## Summary Session 2, 25 Septembre 2024

During this seminar, we talked about data and metadata, research data and got a brief introduction to the Tropy software. In today’s digital age historians, all have to use digital resources at some point in their work, but that doesn’t make every Historian a Digital History Historian. 
Digital History is historical research based on primary sources accessible as electronic data. It can be both digitised sources and born-digital sources.
Data is what can serve as the basis for an analysis, research, data is information. Data can be digital elements that we create, collect, store, manipulate, analyse, interpret, preserve and make available.
There are different research phases. First, we search, localise and gather research materials (Heuristics), then these need to be analysed and interpreted. Then organised and published. The materials also need to be preserved (archived).
Research data are descriptive elements of reality. Qualitative data is gained by observation and quantitative data by measurements. Research data is collected, structured and organise so that we can obtain information and gain knowledge.
Metadata is information about the data. Metadata can be very useful, to find, identify and organise data, evaluate information and provide context. We can use systems to generate metadata. There are two types of metadata, embedded (which is automatically generated by a machine) and enriched (added by a creator or user).
Tropy can be used to organise and archived digital pictures all in one place, in a project and add metadata to them for a better organisation and identification of the data.
