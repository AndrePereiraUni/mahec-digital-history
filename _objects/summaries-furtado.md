## Data, Metadata and Tropy, 25-09-2024

During the session, we learned about and discussed the use of data and metadata. We learned that data is not only something for computer scientists and mathematicians, but that it has a place in many industries and in our private lives due to digitalization. Big data is becoming an integral part of historical sources. We have taken a closer look at what data and metadata are, where they come from and how they can become a historian's tool for scientific research. Furthermore, we have defined that data is something that anyone can create, record, store, observe and analyze. It is very easily accessible and is becoming increasingly widespread through digitization. Metadata is used to describe data. It is created automatically by technology, but can be enhanced by a person or a group. We got the explanation visually with the help of a YouTube video and for further understanding we looked at data sets (Excel) and Twitter posts. Next, we got a brief introduction to Tropy and saw what we could do with it. Finally, we discussed and found out how classmates used data for their thesis. While we were learning all this, we also produced data ourselves while taking notes on Word, and we produced even more by completing this assignment. The course was very interesting. I know that data is very present in my life, but it is something that I am not actively aware of and therefore never really pay attention to. Data can make life and work easier, but I still need to learn how to deal with it. And I should no longer ignore it.

## Web Archives, 02-10-2024

During the class we were divided into groups. The task was to analyze non-profit web archives within about 30 minutes and present them to the class. My group was given the topic “Fluidity of the web” and we had three questions to work on, so we split up the questions and worked indidivelately at first, but we helped each other when we found information that matched the question of the respective assigned person. To answer my question, I looked at the profiles that edited the Wikipedia page, I found two Bots. Bots add information or links to open repositories and fix common errors, but bots cannot recognize when databases contain errors or incomplete information. So they rely on the help of humans. But humans can be biased. I was able to find personal information about the user, such as their religion, origin or job, but some profiles did not contain personal information. 
From the first presentation we mainly learned that it currently results in a lot of lawsuits from companies like book publishers, because these websites provide protected documents and therefore violate laws. In the following, we have learned about the role of the Bnl and Luxembourg Web Archive. The BnL collects, preserves and catalogs all publications related to the Grand Duchy and we learn that the internet/website are not available for eternity. Sources on the internet disappear or are no longer readable/up-to-date. We also see this later in the example of the website The September 11 Digital Archive. Then we learned about Micro-archiving: Family and personal archives in the digital age. Where the students find some information about themselves and family. At the last presentation we learned that many documents are not relatable because many were marked as unkown. We can't trace it's origin back properly.

## Impresso, 09-10-2024

This course was again more about experimentation and independent exploration. In the first part of the lesson we were introduced to the Impresso website. Before that we had to read an article about Impresso that gave background information and explanations to help us follow the course better and sign a contract. In the course itself we were again divided into groups after the presentation and given the task of working with the tools and trying them out to get more familiar with the website. In my group we explored Inspect & Compare. This took a while and required a little help to get familiar with it. The first time we got no result, we tried to get results by translating the word „NATO Doppelbeschuss“ decision into French. The second time we got a result. This time we used the words „NATO Doppelbeschuss“ and Helmut Schmidt. We were then given the task of transferring our results to PowerPoint. In the last part of the course we had to present our founding in a short presentations. The short presentation not only helped us find out what our classmates are interested in, but also made us aware of limitations and other opportunities and gaps. Impresso is an interesting and helpful tool that I can use as a student of the university of luxembourg both for my thesis and for other presentations at the university. 
At the end of the course we talked about GitHub, which helped me better understand why we should use GitHub.
