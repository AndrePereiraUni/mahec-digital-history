## Summary Session 2 - 25 September 

In the second session of the course, we explored the evolving role of digital tools and data in historical research. We began by discussing the distinction between digital history and history in the digital age. While not all historians are "digital historians," many engage with digital sources in their work. We also examined how digital history allows for new methods of analyzing and interpreting primary sources, which are now available as electronic data. We delved into the concept of data, tracing its origin back to ancient Greece and its transformation into a key term in modern languages, signifying information that can be measured or analyzed. We also learned about metadata, which is essential for organizing and retrieving information in the digital world. Metadata provides context, helping historians assess the reliability and relevance of sources. One interesting aspect was the discussion of "data as capta," emphasizing the human role in actively shaping and interpreting data, rather than seeing it as merely given. Additionally, we explored research phases—heuristics, analysis, hermeneutics, dissemination, and preservation—and how digital tools enhance these processes. Through tools like Google Books Ngram Viewer and Tropy, we saw practical applications of these concepts, aiding historians in managing, analyzing, and presenting research. Overall, the session emphases the importance of critical engagement with digital sources, as well as the potential and challenges posed by the digital transformation of historical research.
